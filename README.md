There will be new page for Book Now. Check now will also redirect here.



What if someone wants to book more than one more? Combination of two or more rooms can be suggested if # of guests is more than the capacity of one room. When we select the room and open the room page, we see that we can again modify the previously selected dates and # of people. But some dates or # of people may be invlid for this room if we change. So in a room's page the invalid options should not be selectable.
